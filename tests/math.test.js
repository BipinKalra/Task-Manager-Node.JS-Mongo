// Here the ".test" extension before ".js" lets jest know that this is a test file




// An empty test case like so would pass as it doesn't throw any error
// test("Hello World!", () => {
// })

// Following test case is going to fail.
// test("This should fail!", () => {
//   throw new Error("Failure!")
// })
